This section provides a detailed breakdown of termination, redundancy, medical insurance, working hours, and types of contracts as defined in the Decent Work Act (2015) of Liberia.

1. Termination of Employment
Termination of employment refers to ending an employment relationship between an employer and an employee. It can occur in various ways, including resignation, dismissal, redundancy, or contract expiration.

Retrenchment/Redundancy â€“ Job loss due to economic reasons, downsizing, or company closure.
Retirement â€“ An employee reaches retirement age as per employment terms.

The minimum notice period depends on the length of employment:
Less than 3 months â†’ No notice required.
